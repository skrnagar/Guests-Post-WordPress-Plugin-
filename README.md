<!-- Maybe some points are missing in assignments due to less time.
Because busy in my current work in full week and weekend also.
Created new user 
User Front Page 
Create another page where all the posts created by this author will be listed.
Create a custom post type as “guest posts”
Once the form is sent, the admin should receive the email for page/post moderation. Admin can publish that page/post.
Develop a Post creation form UI on frontend through a shortcode
Below points aren't done due to time, but I can, and I am able to explain:
  Dropdown (Fetch existing custom post type)
  Create a second shortcode or Gutenberg block to show the list of posts which are in pending status for admin approval.   
   The form should be visible only to logged-in authors.

Thank you for giving me opportunities, and I am eager to work with you.
Thanks and regards
